# Intelligent-Gardening-System
An AI and IoT based project which determines the environmental parameters like soil moisture, humidity, raining, temperature etc. and take decision to water a plant or not.
With the rise in the demand of automation in industries and agriculture, we thrive for well optimized automatic solutions, which require least human interventions. The project idea is to achieve this in the field of agriculture. This low energy system is to give the automation to existing irrigation systems an intelligence with the help of machine learning. Raspberry pi along with all the sensors detects the current surrounding conditions like temperature, humidity, moisture, wind speed and the processed image of plant, and applies the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm on the dataset recorded by us previously. A user-friendly GUI also runs parallelly on the raspberry pi local server, through which one can monitor the whole process. The overall is a low cost system, which caters to the need of various agricultural industries and smart farming techniques.
